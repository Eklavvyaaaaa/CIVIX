CIVIX – See It, Snap It, Fix It

Overview
CIVIX is a transparent, community-driven platform for reporting and resolving civic issues. It ensures that real-world problems are not just logged but actually fixed. The system converts citizen complaints into actionable tasks while enforcing accountability through citizen-verified closures and public visibility of outcomes.
By combining automation, artificial intelligence, and a user-friendly design, CIVIX bridges the gap between citizens and civic authorities, creating a reliable and efficient grievance resolution ecosystem.

Problem Statement
Traditional civic issue reporting systems often suffer from poor accountability, slow response times, and low public trust. Complaints are rarely tracked end-to-end, and citizens are left without confirmation when an issue is marked as resolved.
CIVIX addresses these challenges by:
Treating complaints as official tasks
Ensuring transparent, end-to-end tracking
Requiring citizen verification before closure
Providing visible proof of resolution

Photo-based civic issue reporting
Live issue tracking from submission to closure

Automatic before-and-after photo collage generation
Anonymous reporting for user privacy
Mobile-first, user-friendly interface
Seamless integration with municipal workflows

AI-Powered Capabilities
CIVIX uses artificial intelligence to improve speed, accuracy, and efficiency across the platform.
AI-powered issue categorization and triaging
Automated routing to the correct department
